<p>　My name is Lmf, I study in Philosphy ang Government management  Achademy. I major in Administration management.I came from Cheng de,Hebei province,where the emperor avoid summer heat,called by people mountain restort.I hope you can have a visit.<br>　In the first grade, we learn the clsss named Management, we talk about the organization, for example, the campany . The strategy , the leader also will be discussed. I have learned about how to make strategy,how to inspire the employees and so on. Actually ,I didn’t learn very well though I work hard. Because I don’t think it easy to be a good leader, It is related to many things. Just like the equation that the leader’s behaviour depends on whether the followers support him(or her) and the suorrounding whether adapt to the leader.<br>　I have also studied the organizational behavior, the course introduced the personality and psychology as an employee, values、attitudes and job satisfaction of knowledge, is also described as a leader can take incentive measures to explain the relevant incentive theory, also introduced the related enterprises to success stories, these enterprises from the start of appeared in the process of growing a large number enterprises have everfount vitality and success.<br>　If I were a leader, I should have a deep analysis of my advantages and disadvantages, first of all my professional is related to management, I will choose my job according in the knowledge of I learned , relevant theory and practice of the study gave me some experience, let me understand the X theory of evil human nature view ,also learn the y theory the individual needs of view. As a leader, I can better understand the psychological and behavioral characteristics of their activities, take corresponding incentive measures to meet their needs, to achieve the goal of the organization, I am a firm target person and will take action to achieve the goal, just like the Path-goal theory, remove obstacles and indicate the direction for the members of the organization. As my mind clear, in the face of various problems and difficulties, I will be calm and take accurate measures , strong organizational skills, organizational members can collaborative behavior in the organization, the strategic of good accurate positioning, I can develop a reasonable short-term and long-term goals for the organization. I often read related books, and Dulake mentioned in his book that a good manager should have five main habits:<br>１ make good use of time.<br>２ pay attention to contribution.<br>３ good at discovering other people’s strengths.<br>４ distinguish between primary and secondary work.<br>５ make effective decisions.<br>　At the same time I should correct my shortcomings, I think I am careless, sometimes lack of care for members of the organization, when assign the task that I didn’t fully take into account the characteristics of members of the organization, can not maximize the strengths of members of the organization. Hesitate in making decisions and not make the best use of time.<br>　Simply speaking, become a successful leader not only depends on my behaviour and the support of members in the organization, as well as the influence of environment in the promotion. I will pay attention to the influence of environment , and create a good organization environment to achieve the goal,that’s all my instruction.</p>
